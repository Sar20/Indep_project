    <h2> <strong>About Me</strong></h2>

      <p>I have an associated degree in information technology from ITT. I have worked at Intel a few years on contracts. My roles were to troubleshoot network PC and validation both <em>hardwares and some software testing</em>. After having working for a few companies on contract assignment, I was not motivated much with hardwares roles. I figured having skills and experience in software development will be a huge rewarding and job satacfation in the long term.Thus, the future jobs demand more on sofware field than hardwares.</p>
